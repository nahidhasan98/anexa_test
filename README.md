# Shopping Cart

A shopping cart for a fictional e-commerce site. Main objective is to create REST APIs for some specific request/endpoints.

I am using **Go** as the programming language. For database, I am using **MongoDB** (MongoDB Atlas).


## Build & Run

1. Clone the repository (inside the `src` directory of your `GOPATH`) using following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/nahidhasan98/anexa_test.git
```
2. Go inside the project directory:

```bash
cd anexa_test
```

3. Build the project. This will create an executable file named `app.exe` inside the current directory.

```bash
go build -o app.exe
```

4. And finally run the executable file.

```bash
app.exe [for cmd]
./app.exe [for Windows PowerShell]
```
